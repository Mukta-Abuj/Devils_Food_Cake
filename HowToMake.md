1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 180Â°C. Line pans with parchment and grease with pan spray.

2. Combine butter and coffee or tea in a pot or saucier over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat, then mix in cocoa and chocolate, followed by brown sugar, vanilla, and
   salt. Mix in eggs and yolks, then sift in flour and baking soda. Whisk thoroughly.

3. Divide batter between prepared cake pans. Bake until cakes are firm but your finger can still leave an impression in the puffy crust, about 30 minutes (a toothpick
   inserted into the center should come away with a few crumbs still attached).

4. Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a rack, peel off parchment, and return cakes right side up.

5. Voila! Your cake is ready to eat!
